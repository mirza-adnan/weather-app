# Weather App  
Simple Weather App made using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS**. The UI turned out surprisingly good and it's fully functional as well.
## [Live](https://mirza-adnan.github.io/weather-app/)  

## Functionality:
- You can only search for a location using the name of a city.
- Displays **Temperature**, **Wind Speed**, **Pressure** and **Humidity**.
- Hoping to add a Fahrenheit converter in the future.  


## Things I learned:
- Promises, Async/Await, Handling APIs
- Resetting CSS animations
